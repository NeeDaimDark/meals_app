# meals_app

A sample Flutter application that demonstrates building a small recipe/meals application with categories, filters and favorites.

This repository contains the source code and UI for a mobile app built with Flutter. The app shows a list of meal categories, meals in each category, a details page, favorite meals, and a filters screen to restrict visible meals.

## Key features
- Categories screen (grid of categories)
- Meals list per category
- Meal detail screen (ingredients, steps)
- Favorites (mark/unmark meals)
- Filters (gluten-free, lactose-free, vegetarian, vegan)
- Responsive UI built with reusable widgets
- State management using Riverpod and Provider (project contains providers for favourites, filters and meals)

## Technologies
- Flutter (Dart)
- State management: Riverpod + Provider (see providers/ folder)
- Target platforms: Android and iOS

## Project structure (important folders)
- lib/
  - data/: static/dummy data used by the app
  - models/: domain models (Category, Meal)
  - providers/: Riverpod / Provider state modules (favourites_provider.dart, filters_provider.dart, meals_provider.dart)
  - screens/: UI screens (categories, meals, meal_details, filters, tabs)
  - widgets/: reusable UI widgets (category_grid_item, meal_item, main_drawer, ...)
- android/, ios/, web/, windows/, linux/, macos/: platform projects generated by Flutter

## How to run
1. Ensure Flutter SDK is installed and on PATH. Recommended channel: stable.
2. In the project root, run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. To run on a connected device or emulator:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Notes and troubleshooting
- Android NDK mismatch: if you see a message like "Your project is configured with Android NDK 26.x but plugin(s) require 27.x", add/adjust `ndkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to the highest required version (for example: `ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"`). NDK versions are backward compatible.

- Large build artifacts in Git: do NOT commit `build/` or generated platform artifacts. If you already committed build artifacts and Git rejects pushes due to large files, clean the repo and remove those files from history. Typical cleanup steps:
  1. Add proper ignores: ensure a .gitignore containing Flutter defaults exists. At minimum the following directories should be ignored:
     ```
     /build/
     /.dart_tool/
     /android/.gradle/
     /ios/Pods/
     ```
  2. Remove large files from the index (example):
     ```bash
     git rm -r --cached build/
     git commit -m "Remove build artifacts from repo"
     ```
  3. If the large files are already in history, consider using git filter-repo or git-lfs. See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage

- Pushing after cleanup:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Clean: remove build artifacts and add README"
  git push origin main
  ```

## Architecture & design notes
- The app separates UI (screens and widgets) from state (providers) and models. This keeps widgets stateless where possible and moves business logic to providers.
- Filters and favourites are handled via providers so multiple screens can react to state changes.

## Contributing
- Keep platform build artifacts out of commits.
- Open an issue or a pull request with a clear description of the change.
